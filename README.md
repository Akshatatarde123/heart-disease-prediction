# heart-disease-prediction
The health care industries found a large amount of data related to these diseases every year. The project gives the idea of predicting heart disease using machine learning algorithms.  Machine learning is an emerging scientific field in data science dealing with the ways in which machines learn from experience. This Project focuses on recent developments in machine learning which have made significant impacts in the Heart predication. In this project ML algorithms such as Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are used in this project for predicting heart disease on the basis of their features. 
The project also aims to determine the accuracy of each of the ML algorithms and find the best predictor amongst them. The results of the proposed work depict that Logistic Regression is better than the other supervised classifiers. The model gives the results with the highest accuracy of 85.30%.  In future, detailed and further algorithm analysis can be done such as determining and comparing the value of estimators for best accuracy using the Random Forest Classifier, analyzing the implemented linear kernel in SVM with other SVM Classifier Kernels for distinct and comprehensible visualization of its working for better prediction.
